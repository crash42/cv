          <p>
            I am a software engineer at Scott Technology in Dunedin, New Zealand.
            I got my Bachelors in <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/computer-science/index.html">Computer Science</a> at Otago University followed by an Honors,
            Masters, and PhD in <a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/info-science/index.html">Information Science</a>, also from the University of Otago. I specialise
            in Augmented and Virtual Reality (AR/VR) technology and focus largely on 3DUI design and
            development.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Virtualising the Nine-hold Peg Test</strong> In this work I investigated the
        use of Augmented Reality for physical rehabilitation of upper limb impairments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Occlusion and Interaction in Mixed Reality: A Systematic Inquiry</strong> I
        conduct a systematic investigation into the wide array of issues with MR technologies
        which impact one's visual coherence in Mixed Reality systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Interaction and Emotional Response in Immersive Virtual Reality Learning
          Environments</strong> Three major concepts were studied in this thesis: 1) Interaction
          and knowledge in Immersive VR learning environments, 2) Emotional Response as a determinant
          of insightful learning events, and 3) VR application in real-world contexts.
